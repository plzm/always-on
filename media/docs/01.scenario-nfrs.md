## SCENARIO

The solution includes two components for a hypothetical video game:

1. REST APIs to retrieve and upsert player profiles, as well as player progress messages (e.g. points earned). The APIs perform direct data store interaction for player profile retrieval, as well as event sourcing to a message bus for player profile upsert and player progress save.
2. Back end worker to process messages off the message bus and persist them to the data store.

The system must be highly performant with minimal response times at high request volumes to ensure core player experiences are not impacted, and must also achieve global consistency to ensure multiple clients connecting from across the globe receive an accurate view of player data.

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Globally available
- Can add region
- Global data consistency
- Sustain 100,000 tx/sec
- P99 requests <= 200ms
- Availability  99.99%
