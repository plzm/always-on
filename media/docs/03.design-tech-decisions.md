## TECHNOLOGIES

The following technologies will be used at the global level (shared across regions) and in each region.

### Global

- Github
  - Source control
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) artifacts
    - Workload source code
    - Assets including docs, images, etc.
  - Continuous Integration and Deployment
    - Github Actions workflows
  - Issue/task management
- Azure Front Door (AFD)
  - Global load balancer across Azure regions
  - Optimized connectivity with anycast/split TCP
  - Web Access Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS Plan
  - Deployed globally, configured on regional VNets
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Private container registry with regional replication
  - Application environments pull container images from here
- Azure Cosmos DB
  - NoSQL data store
  - Multi-region write
  - Player profiles and progress will be stored here
- Azure Monitor Logs and Application Insights
  - A Logs (Log Analytics) workspace will store diagnostic logs and Azure activity
  - Workloads will send telemetry to Application Insights

### Regional

- User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)
  - Managed Identity assigned to various Azure resources
  - RBAC permissions granted to UAMI
  - Simpler than many System-Assigned Managed Identities
  - More secure than Service Principal, since no explicit secret/password must be stored/provided
- Azure API Management (APIM)
  - API gateway
  - Publish and manage back end APIs
- Application Gateway v2 (AppGW)
  - Intra-regional L7 load balancer
  - WAF capability
  - Used as Ingress Controller for regional AKS cluster
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Managed Kubernetes platform
  - Workloads will run here
- Event Hub
  - High-throughput async messaging platform
  - Provides event sourcing message ingest and delivery
- Azure Key Vault (AKV)
  - Store application secrets
  - Integrated with AKS so workloads can access secure config store
- Azure Networking
  - Virtual Network (VNet) and Network Security Group (NSG)

## DESIGN DECISIONS

### Infrastructure

- Github is used for both source control and CI/CD, as this is a "greenfield" project and to explore Github's CI/CD capabilities
- [Azure Regions with Availability Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-region) (AZs) are used to benefit from increased intra-region resiliency
- [ARM Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/) are used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation due to mature tooling and Github Action support
  - The ARM templates in this project/repo are modular/single-purpose for flexible re-use
- API Management is deployed standalone to each region. APIM multi-region is not used due to its single-region control plane dependency
- Global resources are deployed to a single global Resource Group (RG). Each regional deployment is deployed to its own regional RG
- Azure Cosmos DB is used as the data store due to its high throughput, easy-to-deploy multi-region write, and NoSQL/JSON storage
- One global instance of Azure Monitor Logs and Application Insights is used for simplicity
  - A per-region deployment of Application Insights may make sense to evaluate
- One global Container Registry is deployed, as ACR supports regional replication

### Network

- Each regional deployment will have a standalone VNet and NSGs
  - VNets are be peered across regions, as there is no need for cross-region traffic
  - Each regional VNet has the same network configuration (e.g. address space); if design changes require peering, this may require reconsideration
  - HTTP is used inside the regional resources for greater compute efficiency, as Azure Front Door terminates TLS at the edge
  - AKS networking uses kubenet for simplicity
    - RAW_NET is dropped to mitigate the vulnerability
    - Internal CIDRs are explicitly specified

### Security

- A User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) is provisioned and assigned to resources which support it.
  - A distinct UAMI is deployed to each region. This is to facilitate AKS RBAC. When an AKS instance is configured for managed identity, the managed identity is used to deploy an AKS nodes RG, and is assigned Contributor on that RG.
  - Per-region UAMI supports the principle of least privilege, since the regional UAMI needs only a single permission on a global resource, AcrPull on the global ACR.
  - AKS kubelet and pod identity are additionally configured with the regional UAMI. AKS deployment in turn creates another UAMI in the AKS Nodes RG.

For reference: the UAMI requires the following RBAC assignments so IaC and app deploys can succeed.

| **Name** | **Scope** | **Notes** |
| - | - | - |
| Contributor | Region RG | Needed for AppGW but at RG level for simplicity.
| Contributor | Region AKS Node RG | This is assigned automatically during AKS cluster deploy.
| Network Contributor | Region VNet | Superseded by Region RG Contributor but here to be explicit.
| Managed Identity Operator | Region RG | Superseded by Region RG Contributor but here to be explicit.
| Managed Identity Operator | Region AKS Node RG |
| Virtual Machine Contributor | Region AKS Node RG |
