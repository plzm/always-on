## APPROACH

### LEVEL 1 - SINGLE REGION DEPLOYMENT

1. Templatise foundational resources (AKS, Event Hub, CosmosDB)  and deploy a single regional infrastructure stamp.
2. Create a containerised sample workload using .Net Core or a suitably justified alternative, storing code artefacts . The workload must suitably consider the walkthrough denoted above.
3. Optimise Cosmos access to ensure basic performance targets can be satisfied.
4. Configure the AKS cluster for secure scale and deploy application containers via private repos

#### LEVEL 2 - OPERATIONALISATION

1. Define CI/CD automation pipelines for both the application components and underlying Azure resources (IaC) using Azure DevOps. (Note, I am using Github Actions - GHA.)
2. Operationalisation of application components through robust logging and the integration of all Azure resources with native tooling, such as Log Analytics and Application insights (and container insights).
3. Define and surface a health model for the entire application, applying a 'traffic light' system to represent when the system is healthy
4. Harden the security of the system and demonstrate its resilience to typical security risks, particularly DDoS vulnerabilities.

#### LEVEL 3 - MULTI-REGION EXPANSION

1. Revise deployment pipelines to deploy at least two additional regional stamps in an active-active fashion
2. Define an appropriate data consistency model based on scenario requirements, with multiple masters configured
3. Identify and demonstrate critical failure scenarios throughout the entire application stack
4. Runbook automation for the orchestration of failover scenarios

#### LEVEL 4 - SHOW AND TELL

1. Demonstrate the application meets the performance and availability targets through extensive performance testing and sustained load testing during error and attack scenarios, including DDoS attacks (e.g. BreakingPoint Cloud) and failed AKS nodes.
