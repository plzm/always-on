## WORKLOADS

Two workloads are implemented:

- Front-End API (FE)
  - REST API exposed to video gamer systems on the public internet
  - Operations: get player profile; upsert player profile; create player progress record
  - Player profile upserts and player progress creates are added to a message bus in an event sourcing / CQRS pattern
- Back-End Worker (BE)
  - App which receives profile upserts and player progress creates off the message bus, and persists them to the data store

## SUMMARY FLOW

- Client requests to FE are routed by Front Door and API management to Application Gateway for distribution across AKS cluster(s) within the region to the FE API component
- FE directly retrieves player profile from Cosmos DB when a profile is requested, via point read for efficiency
- FE writes player profile and player progress messages to Event Hub for minimal request latency
- BE reads messages from the regional Event Hub and performs player profile upserts and player progress creates
