## WORKLOAD SUMMARY

Two workloads are implemented:

- Front-End API (FE)
  - REST API exposed to video gamer systems on the public internet
  - Operations: get player profile; upsert player profile; create player progress record
  - Player profile upserts and player progress creates are added to a message bus in an event sourcing / CQRS pattern
- Back-End Worker (BE)
  - App which receives profile upserts and player progress creates off the message bus, and persists them to the data store

## WORKLOAD FLOW

- Client requests to FE are routed by Front Door and API management to Application Gateway for distribution across AKS cluster(s) within the region to the FE API component
- FE directly retrieves player profile from Cosmos DB when a profile is requested, via point read for efficiency
- FE writes player profile and player progress messages to Event Hub for minimal request latency
- BE reads messages from the regional Event Hub and performs player profile upserts and player progress creates

## FRONT END (FE)

- Get Player Profile
  - Provided a player ID (Handle), retrieve the player profile from the data store
- Save Player Progress Data
  - Provided a player progress update, write it to the regional Event Hub
  - These will be assumed to be append-only / event sourcing model, i.e. insert only
- Save Player Profile
  - Provided a player profile, write it to the regional Event Hub
  - These will be assumed to be upserts, so that new players can be created or existing players can be updated

FE API includes OpenAPI specification for easy import to API Management.

## BACK END (BE)

- Process Player Progress Data
  - Pop progress event off Event Hub
  - Persist (create) player progress data to data store
- Process Player Profile
  - Pop profile event off Event Hub
  - Persist (upsert) player summary to data store

## DATA STORE AND MODEL

Cosmos DB with multi-region write is used as the data store.

Two collections will be used, as follows:

- Profiles will store the player profiles
- Progress will store the player progress messages

Both collections will be configured as follows:

- No indexing, as reads will be point reads (specify partition key and index) and there will not be projections or other complex queries that would benefit from indexing
- Autoscale throughput provisioned on each container
- Partition key will be player handle
  - This permits point reads for a player summary, and if analytical or other dependent workloads need it, efficient aggregate queries for events for a specified player
